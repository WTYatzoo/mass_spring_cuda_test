This figure is the result of three versions of mass-spring based cloth simulation with a cloth-fixed rigid sphere coupling example: left: using classical newton method, middle: using fast mass-spring method based on the paper Fast Simulation of Mass-Spring Systems, right: using modified fast mass-spring based on the paper A Chebyshev Semi-Iterative Approach for Accelerating Projective and Position-based Dynamics with a CUDA version Jacobi solver acceleration.
